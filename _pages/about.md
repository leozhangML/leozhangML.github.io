I am a second-year DPhil student in the Department of Statistics (StatML CDT) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Rob Cornish](https://jrmcornish.github.io/), [Saifuddin Syed](https://www.saifsyed.com/) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/).

My research interests currently revolve around the mathematical understanding of deep generative models, and their application to scientific problems, using tools from geometry and category theory. In particular, I am interested in de novo molecular generation and related biochemical problems. 

Previously, I obtained my BSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London and my MSc in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford, where my master's thesis: "Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Manifold Learning" was supervised by [Paul Rosa](https://paulrosa.owlstown.net/) and [Judith Rousseau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3SdlafgAAAAJ&hl=en). You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/leo_zhang_cv.pdf).

If you have any questions or wish to discuss research, feel free to send me an email!
